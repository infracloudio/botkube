A Slack bot which keeps eye on your Kubernetes resources and notifies about resources life cycles events, errors and warnings. It allows you to define and run certain checks on resouces specs.
You can also ask BotKube to execute kubectl commands on k8s cluster which helps debugging an application or cluster.

## Getting started
### Install BotKube app to your Slack workspace
Click the "Add to Slack" button provided to install `BotKube` Slack application to your workspace. Once you authorized the application, you will be provided a BOT Access token. Kindly note down that token which will be required while deploying BotKube controller to your cluster

### Add BotKube to a Slack channel
After installing BotKube app to your Slack workspace, you could see new bot user with name 'BotKube' create in your workspace. Add that bot to a Slack channel you want to receive notification in. (You can add it by inviting using `@BotKube` message in a required channel)

### Installing BotKube controller to your Kubernetes cluster

#### Using helm

- We will be using [helm](https://helm.sh/) to install our k8s controller. Follow [this](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#installing-helm) guide to install helm if you don't have it installed already
- Clone the BotKube github repository.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/infracloudio/botkube.git
```

- Update default **config** in **helm/botkube/values.yaml** to watch the resources you want. (by default you will receive **create**, **delete** and **error** events for all the resources in all the namespaces.)
If you are not interested in events about particular resource, just remove it's entry from the config file.
- Deploy BotKube controller using **helm install** in your cluster.
```bash
$ helm install --name botkube --namespace botkube --set config.communications.slack.channel={SLACK_CHANNEL_NAME},config.communications.slack.token={SLACK_API_TOKEN_FOR_THE_BOT},config.settings.clustername={CLUSTER_NAME},config.settings.allowkubectl={ALLOW_KUBECTL} helm/botkube/
```

  where,<br>
  **SLACK_CHANNEL_NAME** is the channel name where @BotKube is added<br>
  **SLACK_API_TOKEN_FOR_THE_BOT** is the Token you received after installing BotKube app to your Slack workspace<br>
  **CLUSTER_NAME** is the cluster name set in the incoming messages<br>
  **ALLOW_KUBECTL** set true to allow kubectl command execution by BotKube on the cluster<br>

  Configuration syntax is explained [here](https://www.botkube.io/configuration) 

- Send **@BotKube ping** in the channel to see if BotKube is running and responding.

#### Using kubectl

- Make sure that you have kubectl cli installed and have access to Kubernetes cluster
- Download deployment specs yaml

```bash
$ wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/infracloudio/botkube/master/deploy-all-in-one.yaml
```

- Open downloaded **deploy-all-in-one.yaml** and update the configuration.
  Set *SLACK_CHANNEL*, *SLACK_API_TOKEN*, *clustername*, *allowkubectl* and update the resource events configuration you want to receive notifications for in the configmap.

  where,<br>
  **SLACK_CHANNEL** is the channel name where @BotKube is added<br>
  **SLACK_API_TOKEN** is the Token you received after installing BotKube app to your Slack workspace<br>
  **clustername** is the cluster name set in the incoming messages<br>
  **allowkubectl** set true to allow kubectl command execution by BotKube on the cluster<br>

  Configuration syntax is explained [here](https://www.botkube.io/configuration) 

- Create **botkube** namespace and deploy resources

```bash
$ kubectl create ns botkube && kubectl create -f deploy-all-in-one.yaml -n botkube
```

- Check pod status in botkube namespace. Once running, send **@BotKube ping** in the Slack channel to confirm if BotKube is responding correctly.

## Architecture
![](/botkube_arch.jpg)
- **Informer Controller:** Registers informers to kube-apiserver to watch events on the configured k8s resources. It forwards the incoming k8s event to the Event Manager
- **Event Manager:** Extracts required fields from k8s event object and creates a new BotKube event struct. It passes BotKube event struct to the Filter Engine
- **Filter Engine:** Takes the k8s object and BotKube event struct and runs Filters on them. Each filter runs some validations on the k8s object and modifies the messages in the BotKube event struct if required.
- **Notifier:** Finally, notifier sends BotKube event over the configured communication channel.
- **Slack RTM Client:** Slack RTM API authenticates and connects to the Slack messaging server. It parses and forwards the incoming message to Executer. 
- **Executor:** Executes notifier or kubectl command and sends back the result to the RTM client.
